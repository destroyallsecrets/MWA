# Outside We Stand Eternally (OWSE) - Official Portfolio

> **Status:** Phase III (Spatial Optimization & Content Finalization)  
> **LLC:** Outside We Stand Eternally LLC  
> See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for detailed progress.

This is the official primary portfolio and technical hub for **Outside We Stand Eternally LLC**. It is engineered as a high-fidelity immersive coordinate system, bridging technical precision with non-linear navigational dynamics.

## 🏗️ Architectural Pillars
- 💠 **Morphic Void:** A 3D React Three Fiber environment that physically reacts to navigation and scroll state.
- 🧪 **Liquid Glass Engine:** High-saturation, refractive surface suite for modernist UI components.
- 🐚 **Dynamic Shell Architecture:** A modular layout system where project data acts as "liquid" filling specialized architectural vessels (Classic, Immersive, Technical, Modern).
- 📡 **Nexus Registry Sync:** Automated real-time synchronization with GitHub repositories for continuous mirroring.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite 6
- **3D Engine:** React Three Fiber + Three.js
- **Motion:** Framer Motion + Lenis
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (Integrated Architecture)
- **Intelligence:** Swarm-driven development agents
